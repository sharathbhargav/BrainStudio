            "“ Brain chemistry reveals an essential unity of mind and body. Neurons not only contact other neurons, they also connect with skeletal muscles, at a specialized structure called the neuromuscular junction. There the brain uses acetylcholine – its primary chemical neurotransmitter for memory and attention – to communicate with muscles. Another of the brain's key chemical messengers, dopamine, helps regulate fine motor movement.”\n" +

            "John Dewey, a 19th century philosopher, psychologist, and educational reformer said, \"If we teach today as we were taught yesterday, we rob our children of tomorrow\". We must keep children updated with new skills and ways to master their minds. It is no secret that learning something new helps promote a healthy and happy mind. Each time your child learns a new skill, parts of his or her brain get ‘rewired’. Most of the time, we allow our thinking to fall into patterns. For example, we know a certain route to get to a destination and more often than not we follow the same route rather than look for a new way. While following some set patterns is inevitable in everyday life, we have to take measures so our children stay on the path of learning, thereby creating opportunities for ‘rewiring’ of the brain. Rubik's cube is a perfect way to do this.\n" +

    String juggling="Benefits of Juggling\n" +
            "Here are just a few of the reasons that juggling is the ultimate exercise! \n" +
            "\n•\tJuggling is a truly portable workout\n" +
            "The equipment required for juggling is minimal and portable. Juggling scarves or balls fit into your purse, briefcase, backpack or luggage. And you can juggle in large or small spaces. This makes it the perfect exercise for business travellers, or anyone who finds themselves on the road- touring musicians, athletes, adventurers, campers, etc. Juggling is aerobic exercise, as long as you remember to BREATHE while doing it! It may be one of the few (or only) aerobic exercises you can do in a tiny space.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "•\tIt makes you smarter\n" +
            "Yes, it’s true – juggling has been proven to increase the amount of gray matter in the brain. One study even found that it did this in just 7 days! Research also suggests it may prevent Alzheimer’s disease, making it a great choice for brain fitness. When you juggle, you’re not only burning calories, toning your body and strengthening your core, you’re exercising your mind as well.\n" +
            "\n•\t" +
            "Juggling sharpens focus & concentration\n" +
            "Juggling engages your problem-solving skills. You can’t just throw all the balls up in the air and hope everything comes together! This is why juggling is excellent for helping you master the art of concentration.\n" +
            "•\t" +
            "Juggling is the ultimate in stress relief\n" +
            "When you are learning to juggle, you are immediately absorbed in the activity. It’s almost impossible to think of anything but the task at hand. This makes it a great way to escape any worries, stress, hardships, or anything that might be hanging over your head.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "This effect is truly amazing. Juggling truly is one of the quickest ways to take your mind off something, which makes it the perfect form stress relief.\n" +
            "\n•\t" +
            "It doesn’t feel like exercise\n" +
            "Many people are surprised to find out that juggling is exercise, and that is burns 280 calories per hour, much like walking. But juggling definitely makes you laugh, and is entertaining for others to watch, even if you are just learning! What other exercise has that effect? \n" +
            "\n•\t" +
            "You can juggle where you are, no travel required!\n" +
            "Let’s face it, sometimes hitting the gym or going for that long run seems like an impossible wall to climb. Our bodies need a break from exercise, this is normal. Have you ever driven to the gym, started to workout, and then realized your body was not up to it? Juggling is especially great for those times you may not be feeling up to a workout. It requires no time investment – you don’t have to spend money on gas to drive to the gym, or waste that 15 minutes getting to the running trail. You can just pick up the balls and start to juggle. If your body is truly not up for exercise, you can just stop and there you are. No wasted time or gas money!\n" +
            "\n" +

            "•\tJuggling maintains and increases range of motion in the arms and shoulders\n" +
            "Juggling utilizes body mechanics in which we normally do not engage. It’s great to move the body in new ways to maintain range of motion. The expression ‘use it or lose it’ applies here. Juggling lubricates the joints in the arms and shoulders, and keeps them from getting creaky as we age!\n" +
            "\n•\t" +
            "Juggling is one of the best ways to improve coordination\n" +
            "Many people say they can’t juggle because they are too uncoordinated.\n" +
            "Even if you are truly uncoordinated, that’s even more reason to add juggling to your fitness routine. Better coordination will make your daily activities easier and help prevent trips and falls (especially important for senior fitness). By learning more challenging juggling patterns and moves, they can take their coordination to even higher levels. There is no ceiling with juggling – there will always be something even the best juggler in the world cannot do!\n" +
            "\n•\t" +
            "Juggling is beneficial for all age groups and body types\n" +
            "As mentioned in the above section, professional athletes can and do benefit from juggling. Sedentary people, even those that have trouble walking from lack of activity, can also benefit from juggling. One can even learn to juggle while sitting down.\n" +
            "\n•\t" +
            "It helps ward off cravings\n" +
            "Food Cravings\n" +
            "Ever hit that afternoon ‘slump’ where you are not really hungry but eat an unhealthy snack anyway? Juggling for just a few minutes can take your mind off that craving and give you a burst of energy to combat the need for chocolate, soda, or other food! Try reaching for the juggling balls instead of the snack – they may just knock out that craving. Plus, there is no risk of a sugar crash later on!\n" +
            "\n•\t" +
            "Smoking\n" +
            "Many smokers have remarked on how Juggle Fit has helped them quit smoking! Just like with food, juggling diverts your mind from the craving and absorbs you completely in the activity. And if you are trying to quit smoking and are worried about gaining weight, juggling will also burn calories – what a bonus! So next time you crave a cigarette, reach for the juggling balls instead and see if you can knock out that craving! You can learn more about using juggling to quit smoking.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "•\tJuggling makes exercising with family & friends easy\n" +
            "Juggling is the perfect way for a family to exercise together, because everyone can workout at their own level. As parents juggle for exercise, young children can be entertained just by watching. They can also help out with picking up dropped scarves or balls. Parents can teach their children to juggle and incorporate it as a regular family exercise activity. Same goes for you grandparents too! How cool will your grandchildren think it is that you taught them how to juggle?! \n" +
            "Juggling a fun exercise to do with friends. People can share new juggling moves they have learned, help each other troubleshoot problems with their juggling, and even pass balls with each other. It’s also an excellent team-building activity for and organization, because it gets people laughing together! It's a skill that combines incredible balance, creativity and strength.\n" +

            "\n" +
            "•\tThe Multitasking Mind\n" +
            "If the following scenario sounds familiar — you’re driving while making a phone call and listening to your GPS — you are not alone. Around the world, many confess to being on the phone while behind the wheel. While our early ancestors likely also tried to tackle multiple tasks at once, we live in an unprecedented time in terms of our opportunity and temptation to multitask.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "•\tMore than one task splits the brain\n" +
            "Whenever you need to pay attention, an area toward the front of the brain called the prefrontal cortex springs to action. This area, which spans the left and right sides of the brain, is part of the brain’s motivational system. It helps to focus your attention on a goal and coordinates messages with other brain systems to carry out the task. While the right and left sides of the prefrontal cortex work together when focused on a single task, the sides work independently when people attempt to perform two tasks at once.  \n" +
            "\n" +
            "•\tPractice makes perfect?\n" +
            "If performing three things at once is so tough then how come you’re able to reliably eat lunch while checking email and listening to the radio?  while extensive practice can lead a task to become more natural,by mastering juggling  a single activity to the point it becomes automatic is unlikely to make you better at multitasking in general. \n" +
            "\n          In addition to being an inexpensive and fun hobby, juggling may actually be good for you. In fact, in two ways: mentally and physically.\n" +
            "While those who don’t juggle may be surprised, hobbyists who juggle often do so to relax. To non-jugglers, all that tossing and picking-up may seem frustrating, however, juggling requires a certain mind set and focus on the task at hand that can make a person forget about problems at work or the bad day that they have had. The state is known as “relaxed concentration.”\n" +
            "\n•\tBrain Power\n" +
            "it’s been proven that reading, crossword puzzles and other mentally challenging activities are good for the brain, but juggling also makes the list of brain beneficial activities. In 2004, a report from Germany’s University of Regensberg indicated that juggling increases the area of the brain that is associated with visual motion functions. \n" +
            "The second benefit of juggling is physical. The practice of juggling improves the body’s timing and rhythm, as well as peripheral vision, hand-eye coordination and visual reaction time. It’s the reason why lots of coaches recommend that their athletes take up juggling.\n" +
            "To my knowledge, there are no downsides to juggling. So if you’re looking for a low-cost activity that can work your brain, encourage you to focus and relax and improve your coordination and timing, what are you waiting for? It’s never too late to start.\n" +
            "\n1. Juggling exercises and integrates the “right” and “left” brain. what psychologists call the left brain, the logical, analytic, and narrowly focused side. Once you have learned how to juggle, you move into “right” brained thinking, the side that is more intuitive and holistic.   When this happens, juggling becomes automatic and relaxing. Some call it a moving meditation. The left  and right movement across the body literally changes our focus from left to right and back again. \n" +
            "\n2. Research has shown that there is a direct relationship between hand-eye  coordination and the ability to read and write. Schools are teaching juggling as a way to enhance academic learning. The eye crosses midline and the  movement improves concentration, encourages sequencing, and increases tracking. \n" +
            "\n3. Recent research has found that it is never too late to grow dendrites  or connective cells in the brain. Nerve cells are designed to be stimulated by new input which in turn builds a richer brain structure. New learning creates a reserve of dense connections partially protecting us from cell loss associated with Alzheimer’s disease.\n" +
            "\n4. Juggling is a self-esteem booster. Juggling gives kids and adults tangible evidence of accomplishment. When students can get up and perform successfully for adults or other students, self esteem soars. Learning this newly acquired, yet heretofore seemingly impossible skill, causes all of us to take a second look at the other things we thought we couldn’t do. It challenges all our other beliefs about what is possible. \n" +
            "\n5. Students who get up and move around energetically on a regular basis return to academic tasks refreshed and will learn better as a result.\n" +
            "\n6. Juggling turns everyone into a participant. We tend to sort ourselves out around the age of 12 into spectators and participants. With juggling, everyone plays. Juggling is non-competitive when done individually, and requires cooperation when two or more work together. For many adults, it is the first new physical skill they have learned in a long time.\n" +
            "Juggling is joyful.\n";

            "Students’ hand-eye coordination and reaction time increased after participating in a five-week cup stacking physical education program at school. Cup stacking allows the child to use both hands in motion together (bilateral coordination). Increasing bilateral proficiency helps the brain develop on the right side as well as the left. In many cases, the right side of the brain loses out in day-to-day functions so this activity builds an increase of awareness, creativity and focus, which are all housed in the right hemisphere of the brain.\n" +
            "Because cup stacking activities become more about speed overtime, the child’s hand-eye coordination and bilateral coordination must become more accurate and precise. This means your child’s reaction time must become faster and they must retain visual information much quicker. These skills are necessary for helping children take exams and tests. Many of them are timed tests and become more difficult as they get older. Cup stacking can help a child process and comprehend information on their exams faster and more accurately so they can retrieve the details needed to select the best answer to the question or problem.  \n" +
